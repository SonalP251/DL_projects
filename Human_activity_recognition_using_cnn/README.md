# Human Activity Recognition:
### Dataset Link:https://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php
### Description:
#### Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using smartphones dataset and a CNN. Classifying the type of movement amongst six categories:
1. Walking, 
2. Jogging, 
3. Upstairs, 
4. Downstairs, 
5. Sitting, 
6. Standing

#### Activity Recognition (AR) is monitoring the liveliness of a person by using smart phone. Smart phones are used in a wider manner and it becomes one of the ways to identify the humanâ€™s environmental changes by using the sensors in smart mobiles. Smart phones are equipped in detecting sensors like gyroscope and accelerometer. The contraption is demonstrated to examine the state of an individual.

#### Human Activity Recognition (HAR) framework collects the raw data from sensors and observes the human movement using different deep learning approach. Deep learning  models are proposed to identify motions of humans with plausible high accuracy by using sensed data.

#### Human activity recognition, is a challenging time series classification task. It involves predicting the movement of a person based on sensor data and traditionally involves deep domain expertise and methods from signal processing to correctly engineer features from the raw data in order to fit a machine learning or Deep learning model or in other words you can call, it is a multiclass classification problem, for given a new datapoint we have to predict the Human Activity. And Each datapoint corresponds one of the 6 Activities.
