# **Brain tumor classification using keras**
In this dEEP learning project, we builT a classifier to detect the brain tumor (if any) from the MRI scan images. This is a binary classification problem.


### Dataset:[Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection)
The images are split into two folders yes and no each containing images with and without brain tumors respectively. There are a total of 253 images.

### Our approach to building the classifier is discussed in the steps:

1.Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on brain tumor dataset

2.Build a CNN model

3.Train and Evaluate our model on the dataset
